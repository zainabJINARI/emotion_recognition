This demo showcases the interface for using the Emotion Recognition application with static images. Users can load an image and obtain the emotion labels associated with individuals present in the image.

4. Real-Time Video Emotion Recognition




The real-time video demo demonstrates the functionality of the Emotion Recognition application with live video streams. Users can observe the application detecting and tracking emotions in real-time as individuals express different emotions.

# Usage
To use the Emotion Recognition application, follow these steps:

Ensure that Python is installed on your computer.
Clone the project repository from GitHub.
